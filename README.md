# DuPont Model-visualization

### Background Info: 
The DuPont Analysis attempts to explain where the profitabiltiy (measured in Return on Equity ROE)
of a firm comes from. 

The 5-Component Model says that there are 5 factors that explain profitability:
ROE = 
1. How leveraged a company is (to what extent is the firm funded by debt)
	- Measured by the Equity Multiplier
	- Total Assets / Total Equity
2. How efficient a company is at usting its assets to generate revenue
	- measured by Asset Turnover Ratio
	- Revenues / Total Assets
3. Profitability from operations (Operating Efficiency)
	- Measured by Operating Margin
	- Operating Income / Revenue
4. Interest Burden
	- Earnings Before Taxes / Operating Income (or EBIT)
5. Tax Burden
	- Net Income / EBT


### Project Overview:
This project attempts to visualize the 5-point model. 

### Functionality
	- users can type in the name of a publicly listed company into a search bar
	- a graph will appear showing the breakdown of ROE (to what extent each factor affects ROE)
	- there are options/buttons to toggle between different graphs/visualizations

### Technologies Employed
- Vanila JavaScript
- D3 for data mapping
- Webpack
- HTML/CSS


### MVPS
- 1 Search Bar. user can type in the name of a company
- 2 Main Graph- displays breakdown of each factor
- 3 other graphs- users can toggle between different graph types (2 point, and 3 point breakdown)
